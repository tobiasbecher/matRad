function matRad_plotParetoSurface(fInd,penGrid,VOIObj)
% matRad function that plots a color coded Pareto Surface. Colors are based
% on penalty values of the data points in 3 dimensions.
% Red means higher penalties of objective plotted along x-axis.
% Green means higher penalties of objective plotted along y-axis.
% Blue means higher penalties of objective plotted along z-axis.
%
% call
%   cBarHandle = matRad_plotColorbar(axesHandle,cMap,window,varargin)
%
% input
%   axesHandle  handle to axes the colorbar will be attached to
%   cMap        corresponding colormap
%   window      colormap window (corresponds to clim)
%   varargin    additional key-value pairs that will be forwarded to the
%               MATLAB colorbar(__) call
%
% output
%   cBarHandle  handle of the colorbar object
